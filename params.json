{"name":"Nila","tagline":"A Dialect of Coffeescript with a Rubyspired Syntax","body":"# Nila\r\n\r\nNila is a dialect of Coffeescript that leans towards a more Ruby oriented syntax. Nilac is the official compiler for the Nila language. Nila is still in its infancy and is not suitable for day to day usage.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nYou will definitely need\r\n\r\n* Ruby (1.90>) and Rubygems\r\n* Node.js with NPM \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can install Nila yourself through Rubygems. Just run:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install nilac\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo compile your Nila file:\r\n\r\n\t$ nilac -c file.nila\r\n\r\nTo compile and run your Nila file (requires Node.js):\r\n\r\n\t$ nilac -r file.nila\r\n\r\nA detailed documentation is available at https://github.com/adhithyan15/nila/wiki/Documentation\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nWe currently use a homemade micro-testing framework called **Shark** to test our code. You can run tests by calling\r\n\r\n    $ Shark -t\r\n\r\nShark uses Cucumber like syntax and you can read all the tests we have written in the **Shark/features** directory and all the files used in the test are stored in the **Shark/test_files** directory. If you want to know more about Shark, please visit https://github.com/adhithyan15/shark  \r\n\r\n## Issues and Bugs\r\n\r\nWe utilize Github's issues page to keep track of issues and bugs. You can also post feature requests there. We are trying to close as many issues as possible.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2.
