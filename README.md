# Nila

Nila is a dialect of Coffeescript with a Rubyspired syntax. Nilac is the official compiler for the Nila language. Nila language is
still in its infancy. The gems released are developmental releases not production releases. So use with caution.  

## Requirements

You will definitely need

* Ruby 2.0 and Rubygems
* Node.js with NPM 

## Installation

You can install Nila yourself through Rubygems. Just run:

    $ gem install nilac

## Usage

To compile your Nila file:

	$ nilac -c file.nila

To compile and run your Nila file (requires Node.js):

	$ nilac -r file.nila

## Documentation

A detailed documentation of the language is available at https://github.com/adhithyan15/nila/wiki/Documentation. Currently, we are working to ship RDoc and Ri based documentation along with the Nilac gem.  

## Tests

We currently use a homemade micro-testing framework called **Shark** to test our code. You can run tests by calling

    $ Shark -t

Shark uses Cucumber like syntax and you can read all the tests we have written in the **Shark/features** directory and all the files used in the test are stored in the **Shark/test_files** directory. If you want to know more about Shark, please visit https://github.com/adhithyan15/shark
